  <h2>My Full Appeal for Ish's discord server</h2>

  <p>Hello, <br>
Not long ago I received a message from your bot stating that I was permanently banned from the server for the reason: “racial slurs won’t be tolerated, even outside the server.” I would like to explain my position on this matter and why I believe the punishment is unfair.</p>

<p>First of all, I believe I know who attempted to get me banned (and if I’m “guessing” correctly, this only supports my claims with factual grounds). It is either someone named Peter_Barker or flamefragger.</p>

<p>The reason they went out of their way and spent time trying to get a stranger banned from a Discord server is because about two weeks ago they formed a group in my my recent Civilization event. My staff team and I decided to ban them from the event and from participating in future events. Here is the announcement we published: “ ”. I hope you understand why we banned them.</p>

<p>Now, regarding the video they brought to your attention simply because they had a personal issue with me:</p>

<p>First, towards the end they claim that I said the N-word. Honestly, I don’t remember too much from that conversation (it was over a month ago), but I really don’t think that was the word. You cannot hear me say either “g” or “r,” two letters without which the word cannot actually be spoken.</p>

<p>And let’s say, hypothetically, that it was the word — you can hear that I stopped myself before saying it. I don’t remember the conversation very well, but I clearly remember the day. It was the third day of my fourth event, and after they began ruining my event, they insulted me throughout the entire day. I think (not 100% sure) that You can even hear one of them swearing at me in the very same recording that was sent to you. At worst, this was a minor slip of frustration after a long day — and even then, I did not clearly say the word.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I want to emphasize that I strongly condemn all racism against any group of people, including Black people. I have already banned several people from my Discord server for writing or saying that word. However, in those cases, they said it very clearly and with racist intent.</p>

<p>So let’s assume hypothetically (despite the lack of real reason to believe it) that I did say the N-word. Was it really said with racist intent? None of the participants in the conversation were Black (at least to my knowledge, since I don’t actually know what they look like). The word, if it was spoken, came out of frustration, and not because I intended to target anyone in such a way.</p>

<p>There are many examples of people who mistakenly said the word in similar situations — for instance, PewDiePie — and they were still forgiven, because it was understood that it came out unintentionally and not from a place of racism.</p>

<p>But you know what is real racism? Supporting Hitler and his actions — which is something flamefragger himself has declared in the past.</p>

<p>I hope you understand that there is no real reason to believe I said the word, and even if for some reason you believe I did, it was absolutely not said from a racist standpoint.</p>

<p>By the way, I’m using ChatGPT to translate this message. I first write it in my native language and then translate it with it (I do this because it’s easier for me to express myself and phrase my thoughts in my native language).</p>

<p>Finally, I want to make it clear that I am not racist, and I sincerely apologize if it seemed like I was. I can promise that I will never say the kind of words that it may have sounded like I said in that video.</p>
